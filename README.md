Why do we need Terraform Cloud (or another backend) when we use CI/CD?

1. **State Management:** Terraform stores its state, which is a snapshot of the infrastructure at a given point in time. In a CI/CD setup, the infrastructure might be managed by multiple pipelines or team members. Without a centralized state (like what Terraform Cloud provides), there is a risk of state conflicts, which can lead to inconsistencies or even disasters in the infrastructure.

2. **Collaboration:** Terraform Cloud offers features for team collaboration. When there are multiple devs working on infrastructure, it's crucial to manage who's doing what and to ensure that changes are applied in a controlled manner. Terraform Cloud provides access controls, review processes, and a history of changes, which are super useful for teamwork.

3. **Security:** Managing secrets and credentials is a big deal. With CI/CD, it's often needed to provide access to various resources. Terraform Cloud can securely store and inject these credentials into Terraform runs, which reduces the risk of exposing them in the CI/CD pipelines or the codebase.

4. **Remote Operations:** Running Terraform locally or even in a CI/CD pipeline can sometimes be resource-intensive. Terraform Cloud can execute these operations remotely, which can be more efficient and secure. It's especially handy when dealing with large infrastructures.

5. **Consistency and Reliability:** Using a backend like Terraform Cloud ensures that the Terraform operations are consistent and repeatable across different environments and team members. This is crucial for reliability, especially in a professional setting.

In a nutshell, while you can use Terraform with CI/CD without a backend like Terraform Cloud, using one provides significant benefits in terms of state management, collaboration, security, and operational efficiency. It's like having a solid and secure foundation when building something complex like the infrastructure managed by Terraform.
